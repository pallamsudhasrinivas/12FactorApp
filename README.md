The 12 Factor App ia a methodology to for building software as a service app that:

  1. Setup automation to minimize time and cost for making new developers life simple who are joining the project
  2. OS independent, offering maximum portability between execution environments
  3. Suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms
  4. Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility
  5. And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices

The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services

Following are the 12 Factors

  1.  Codebase: 
  2.  Dependencies:
  3.  Config:
  4.  Backing Services:
  5.  Build, release, run:
  6.  Processes
  7.  Port Binding:
  8.  Concurrecy
  9.  Disposability
  10.  Dev / Prod parity
  11.  Logs
